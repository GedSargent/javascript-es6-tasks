# Basic JavaScript ES6 for React Challenges

## Cloning in Github Desktop

In Github Desktop, select _File > Clone Respository_ from the menu.

In the dialogue box that appears, clone the project somewhere on your machine _*outside of OneDrive, or any other folder that will automatically sync to the cloud*_. It's best to find your user folder, and create a subdirectory there called 'development' that you can house everything in.

## Getting started

Each file in this project contains a challenge for you to solve with JavaScript ES6. The challenges are geared towards ES6 syntax that you will use regularly in React.

At the top of each file is a resource you can use to help solve the problem. The majority of these resources are found on the wonderful [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) website, so sign up for a free account if you haven't already. There are a few other resources listed as well.

## Running the code and checking solutions

1. It is recommended that you open this project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. In VS Code, install the rather brilliant [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension. Read the Code Runner documentation [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner#usages) to learn how to run your code with the extension right inside VS Code itself.
